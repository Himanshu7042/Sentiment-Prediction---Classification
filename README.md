# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The target variable is binary, indicating whether a review is positive or negative. The dataset includes movie titles, descriptions, genres, durations, directors, actors, users' ratings, review texts, and reviewer names.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this stage, the dataset is analyzed for biases, outliers, and data distribution. The relationships between the target variable and other features like duration and genres are explored.

## Data Preprocessing

Missing data is handled, and transformations such as standard scaling for numerical features and one-hot encoding for categorical variables are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

## Modeling

Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and SGD Classifier are implemented. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance. The models are evaluated and compared using appropriate metrics.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid search and cross-validation are employed to fine-tune the model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
